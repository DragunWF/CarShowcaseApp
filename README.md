## Problem Statement

You are the marketing director for a multi-brand car dealership that needs to improve its digital presence. Your salespeople are struggling to effectively showcase vehicle inventory when interacting with customers, especially during off-site events or when specific models aren't available on the showroom floor. Customers often request detailed information and visuals of various models, but your current solution relies on printed brochures or navigating through multiple manufacturer websites, which is cumbersome and unprofessional.

To solve this problem, you need to develop a Car Showcase App that allows your sales team to quickly access and present high-quality visuals and information about your entire vehicle inventory in an engaging and professional manner.
